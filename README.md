#ExactTarget's Node on the Road Slides

These are the slides from the presentation [Gary Borton][2] and [I][3] gave at Node on the Road on 6/19/14, presented by Joyent.

Purposefully, the slides have very little content. Topics we discussed can be seen in the speaker notes section of the slides.

The video is up on [Joyent's website][1]. Have fun.
